# Official 1010V Repository
In this repository is our teams code, and hopefully soon some pictures of our team and robot

Code written in C++ and compiled for the Vex V5 microcontroller for use with a master and partner controller

Please note that as of the end of the 2021-2022 season, our team has officially left VEX Robotics, as such, this repo will no longer be recieving updates.  As sad as this is, I hope that this repo remains a valuable learning reasource for those both within and outside of the Ten Ton Robotics Academy.
