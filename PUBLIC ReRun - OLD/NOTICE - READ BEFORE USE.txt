The code here is NOT complete!
In this folder is SOME (Not All) of the code required to record and playback driver input.
The concept of this is NOT mine and was originaly created by Henry at Ten Ton robotics - All credit for coming up with this goes to him.
The code here was co-developed with Aryan, and is published with his consent.
If this code is abused it WILL ba taken down

The code was left uncomplete because not everyone should have access to it, 
if you can figure out how it works and make your own, then you are worthy.

This code includes the CPP files for recording and playing back driver input, the code here also works only with two (2) motors and is licenced under the MPL 2.0 Licence
This means if you choose to use it you MUST present it to judges, teammates, coaches, ext as the intellectual property as Henrys, and the code itself is a modified version of this code here.
This is not an ask, there is no "but" or "if" YOU MUST.

We did not come up with this, neither did you.
Credit goes to Henry.

These are the terms of using this code and/or learning from it, abuse them and the code will be made private.
